# Developer Notes

- Re-architect the html elements, instead exclusive based class into more general class based architect

- Rename pages into what they're present without using symbols e.g ( **-** , **_** ) just a name that represent the content and purpose of this page

- Use folder based routes for identification and reading purposes making routes more easy to understand yet easy to access giving the developer a confusion free experience

- Relay on the concept of **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself) meaning create once use everywhere

# Things to be made later
- Refactor basically all pages into more tailwind based using ***global.css***
